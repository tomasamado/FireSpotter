A react-native app that allows you to search songs from Spotify and display some of the fun audio features the Spotify API offers, such as: Danceability, Energy, Valence and others. I wanted to name it spot-a-fire but spotify's branding guidelines don't let app names to begin with "spot" or to sound similar to "spotifire".
